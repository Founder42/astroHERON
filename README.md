# astroHERON
- stands for **"ASTROphysical High-EneRgy data reduction: OpeN-source code"**
- This is a collection of useful codes and scripts for data reduction, spectral and image analysis for high-energy astrophysics (especially for X-ray astronomy).
- The name comes after one of the author's favorite bird: Black-crowned Night Heron (_Nycticorax nycticorax_), very popular in either city or countryard in China, alson known as 'Chinese Rural penguin' (because it has similar color pattern and is sometimes found staying sneakily in the penguin area of the zoo, pretending itself as a penguin waiting to be fed by the zookeeper). It is active in the evening, often fronzenly stands by the river.
